To get started double click GainzApp.exe. This will open a command prompt that you can leave open while using GainzApp. 

If you see a windows security notification choose More Info then Run anyways. This is because the publisher (me) is not registered with Microsoft. 

Open a web browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to login with username: admin password: admin

If you are importing transactions from a source other than Coinbase or Cash App you can enter them into "Import_Transactions_Template.xlsx" before importing them to Gainz. 
Or 
Manually one at a time on the Manage Transactions Page. 

contact admin@cryptogainz.store for any inquiry. 

Thank you and I hope it's exactly what you were looking for!
